"""Score webcore with an ALL-OR-NOTHING regression gate.

This is a deliberate variant of the canonical webcore run_score.py: it
keeps the same anti-cheat (each test id is loaded in ISOLATION from the pristine
checker_data/suite/, never from the agent's workspace) but changes only the
score AGGREGATION.

    SCORE = 0.3 * (1 if ALL regression tests pass else 0)
          + 0.7 * (fraction of feature tests passing)

Regression is all-or-nothing on purpose: the 0.3 block is awarded only when
*every* test_regression_* test passes, and a SINGLE regression failure forfeits
the entire block (there is no partial regression credit). This is the
anti-gaming choice for a feature-add task -- it refuses to reward feature work
that breaks existing behavior, so the only way to climb toward 1.0 is to add the
feature WITHOUT regressing. Feature tests (test_feature_*) are scored
individually. Exit 0 only when every test (regression and feature) passes."""
