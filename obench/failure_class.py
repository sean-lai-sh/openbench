"""Failure taxonomy shared by the runner, reports, and backfill tool.

The runner classifies rows at write time using the adapter's full untruncated
output when adapters provide ``full_output``. Backfill can only use fields saved
in old JSONL rows (usually ``output_tail``), so old-file detection is inherently
weaker for markers that were truncated away.

Rows that ride the wall-time cap normally classify as ``timeout``. A cap-riding
row with no evidence of agent work is treated as harness/provider infra instead:
no tokens, no turns, and effectively empty saved output/text after generic
headers and timeout boilerplate are removed. Genuine timeouts still show work via
tokens, turns, or meaningful transcript/error text and remain ``timeout``.

Zero-work classifier gate (P0 hardening)
-----------------------------------------
A completed cell with zero output tokens AND at most 1 turn AND no meaningful
adapter-output text is infrastructure, never a capability "wrong answer."
The canonical pattern is a gpt-5.6-sol cell that completes in 2--9s wall time
with 0 output tokens and exactly 1 turn — the harness started, the model
returned nothing useful (connection dropped, auth rejected early, or the
adapter's minimal turn was a probe that got no response), and the cell
finished without the adapter crashing visibly.

This is symmetric with the crash-marker / adapter-traceback gate: when no
model output was produced, the failure belongs to the harness or provider, not
the model's ability to solve the task.
